# Today's TODOs: FocusCenter Project

## 1. Backend Foundation
- [x] Design and implement Python database models to match the Supabase schema (users, goals, tasks, ai_chats, motivational_quotes, motivations, analytics, notes)

## 2. Backend API
- [x] Set up CRUD API endpoints for each model (users, goals, tasks, etc.)

## 3. Agent Modules
- [x] Create stubs for agent modules (Goal Understanding, Task Breakdown, Distraction Tracking, Motivation, Analytics)

## 4. Frontend Skeleton
- [ ] Scaffold React frontend: basic navigation, placeholder pages for onboarding, goals, tasks, chat, motivation, analytics, notes

## 5. Frontend-Backend Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API for at least one entity (e.g., fetch and display goals)

---
- [ ] Commit and push progress regularly
- [ ] Update this file as tasks are completed or reprioritized

## Dashboard & Goals/Analytics Enhancements (Next Steps)

1. Add New Goal Button on Goals page (modal form, save to Supabase, show newest first)
2. Enhance Goal Cards: show creation time, add edit/delete button, visually appealing
3. Integrate with Supabase for all goal data (CRUD, subgoals, streaks, creation time)
4. Polish all pages for visual consistency and appeal
5. Analytics Page: overall trends (total goals, completed, streaks, etc.)
6. Goal Analytics: per-goal stats on detail page (progress, streak, completion rate)
7. Dashboard Analytics: common trends for all goals (charts, stats)
